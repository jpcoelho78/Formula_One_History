        Scuderia Ferrari was found on 16 November 1929 by Enzo Ferrari. Ferrari was supported in his project by brothers Augusto and Alfredo Caniano who were heris to a textile fortune. Ferrari amassed a group of over 40 amateur drivers, and enlisted the support of Alfa Romeo which had temporarily withdrawn from racing in 1925. Ferrari gained a guarantee of technical assistance from Alfa with stock in his company. He then secured similar deals with companies Bosch, Pirelli and Shell. None of the drivers were paid a set salary, instead they received a percentage of any prize money won by he team. They were expect to get to the race while the Scuderia would deliver the car and pay any entrance fees or duties. Scuderia Ferrari competed in 22 events in it's first year, winning 8 of them along with several other good results. In 1930, the great Tazio Nuvolari joined Giuseppe Campari at the team. The well-known prancing horse blazon was first used at the 1932 Spa 24 Hours in Belgium on a two-car team of Alfa Romeo 8C 2300 Spiders, which finished first and second.
        
    <p class="texto_ferrari">After the end of the Second World War Enzo recruited several of his former Alfa colleagues and established a new Scuderia Ferrari, which would design and build its own cars. Along with his old collaborator Gioacchino Colombo, Ferrari began to construct his own Grand Prix racing car, the 1.5L 125. The 125 competed at several non-championship Grands Prix before the establishment of the Formula One World Championship, however it did not secure any wins. Rules for a Grand Prix World Championship had been laid out before the war but it took several years afterward for the series to get going.
